            Conclusion
        </h3>

            <p>
                I enjoyed my time designing this project. As a former personal trainer, I was tempted to rely on my own experiences and assumptions to develop the app. In lieu of that, I stayed true to my UX knowledge and principles. When questions arose, I sought to answer them using surveys, interiews and user testing. After utilizing research and tools I had gathered, I was able to come up with solutions that were researched, tested and approved, thus making each new iteration better than the last.
